# **Crypter**

**A secure bank management system**

## Introduction

This project is a simple bank system made using the C language with file handling. It allows
users to create accounts, log in with a PIN, deposit and withdraw money, and check their
transaction history. The aim is to build a secure and useful system while practicing C
concepts like structures, file input/output, and authentication.

## Objectives

- To implement secure PIN-based authentication for each banking operation.
- To enable account holders to deposit and withdraw money after successful authentication.
- To record and maintain a transaction history for each account using separate files.
- To provide an option to delete an account securely.
- To ensure data persistence using file handling for both account information and transaction logs.
- To enhance understanding of structured programming, file operations, and basic security mechanisms in C.
